These are really basic choice of units and\\nthere is only G. but quite apart from that, you have these three fundamental constants\\nof nature. You can construct from them, quantities of dimensions; mass, length and time, by taking\\nsuitable combinations of h, c and G. So I request to do this. In combinations of h to\\nthe power alpha, G to the power beta, c to the power gamma, find alpha, beta and gamma\\nsuch that, you get a length or a mass or a time and these are the Planck mass, Planck\\nlength, Planck time, etc. Now clearly, those would be the natural length\\nscales and time scales, when gravity as well as quantum mechanics will play a role because\\ngravity is represented by this and quantum mechanics by that. And it turns out that the\\n      Question: is the topic of nuclear fusion discussed in this video? if yes then what was discussed\\n    \")"
